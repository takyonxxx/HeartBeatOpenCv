# Heart Rate Measurement Using Face Detection

Face tracking and skin segmentation algorithms are used to locate the regions of interest (ROIs) in in-coming frames from the front-facing camera.
Sensing.

Face detection combined with object tracking is used to produce a set of face rectangles, which are sampled in the later stages of the pipeline for color variations. The average of the color, in a region of interest (ROI) chosen on the face, represents a signal which corresponds to the heart rate. Using signal processing, a heart rate frequency can be extracted from this signal. The method is quite precise and stable. 
Please try do not move until the correct signal is obtained. When the sine signal is seen, it means the correct signals are started to capture.
